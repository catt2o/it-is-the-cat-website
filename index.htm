<h1 style="color:Blue;">Cutie's journey as a cat to siopao</h1>
<p>Early in the morning, Cutie roams around the streets of a place he is quite unfamiliar with. He walked past a store where I used to work. At first, I thought he was abandoned by his owner (Jae). I offered Cutie a coffee inside my tiny restaurant. He seems uninterested in the drink I served him. so I prepared a siopao instead. Out of nervousness he might not like it again, I dropped the food accidentally. He ran to me and ate it, and I witnessed his smiling face, which resembles the siopao he's eating. Then I realized what an adorable cat he is, and I have named him Siopao ever since.</p>
